It is conventional not to check in generated files (e.g. the .stls), however it's convenient at this moment to do so. TODO: fix this

### Constraints

#### frame.stl

- the tray is wide enough for a Core, ~22mm wide, ~9mm high (TODO check height)
- the tray-side gaps are large enough for Core pins, ~3mm wide, ~40mm long
- the gap under the tray is enough for the connecting wires, ~11mm (TODO check)
- the roof pitch implied by the front and back is at least 45 degrees
- the length of the unit is enough for the USB to bend round to the front, ~73mm

#### shell.stl

- roof pitch is at least 45mm
- 1mm clearance of frame at all contact points so the frame will definitely fit, albeit at some risk of being loose
- skirt is deliberately wider then enough to compensate
